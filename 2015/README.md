Out of ~800 entries, 12 of mine placed in the top 100. I am keeping a record of these algorithms and results so that hopefully I can fine-tune my algorithm and do better next year. 

Next to each bracket is a short description of how it varies from my best bracket, which teams performed better in real life than in my algorithm (overachievers), and which teams performed better in my algorithm than in real life (underachievers).
