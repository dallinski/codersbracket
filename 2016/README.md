Out of 550 entries, 50 of mine placed in the top 100! I had all of the top 5 submissions, 8 of the top 10, and 17 of the top 25.

- Submitted 50 brackets using [random1.js](./algorithms/random1.js)
 - 5 of those brackets were in the 90th percentile or better
    - <img src="./images/4.png" width="100" /><img src="./images/6.png" width="100" /><img src="./images/17.png" width="100" /><img src="./images/23.png" width="100" />#2 overall<img src="./images/50.png" width="300" />
 - 19 of those brackets were in the 40th percentile or worse

- Submitted 50 brackets using [random2.js](./algorithms/random2.js)
 - 1 of those brackets were in the 90th percentile or better
    - <img src="./images/71.png" width="100" />
 - 28 of those brackets were in the 40th percentile or worse

- Submitted 1 bracket using [jsseph_mov_rpi.js](./algorithms/jsseph_mov_rpi.js) (I ran this algorithm 25 times and beyond the first round, the results were nearly identical, so I figured there was no need to submit multiple brackets using this algorithm)
 - It did well, scoring 940 points, which put it in the 94.7 percentile

- Submitted 24 brackets using [danmanstx.js](./algorithms/danmanstx.js)
 - This algorithm heavily favors UNC and Michigan State. Mostly it just likes higher seeds advancing.

 - 1 of those brackets were in the 40th percentile or worse
