# March Madness Javascript algorithms

Documenting/preserving my algorithms so that I can hopefully improve on them from year to year.

#### New for 2016: Defensive stats
I wrote an email to Fullstack Academy, requesting that they add defensive stats to their "API". They responded that they already include steals, rebounds, and blocks, and then insinuated that those are sufficient. Defense wins championships, so those three statistical categories did not satisfy me. I wanted more stats (and more meaningful stats), and discovered that the NCAA actually publishes quite a few useful defensive stats (defensive fg%, turnover margin, scoring defense, etc). So I wrote my own web scraper in Python to grab the stats from the NCAA pages. Now I can run the scraper and copy/paste the results into my Javascript algorithms.
